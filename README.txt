We've had to remove 6 tests which did not run due to dockers differing file structure.

Note:
The format in which our wc application outputs data may be different to how you may have

Piping certain applications prove to be more useful for example
ls | wc in a directory with no folders will output the word count for all files in
the folder

Extension Taks:
Colourful UI

Added Mv
